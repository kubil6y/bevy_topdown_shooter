# Topdown Space Shooter

Built with Bevy 0.9. Heavily inspired by [Jeremy Chone](https://www.youtube.com/@JeremyChone). Apart from Jeremy's shooter, i have used bevy events and created an endless space shooter game for learning purposes. For every 10 kill everything gets faster.

ESDF/Arrows to move, SPACE to shoot.
